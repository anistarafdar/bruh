## Install

If you have `zig 5.0+b7be57766` and some recent version of `go`, you should be able to just run `./install`.
If yoo do not have either, you can choose to use the prebuilt binaries in [dist](https://github.com/haze/bruh/blob/master/dist).
If you like doing things manually, feel free to check out the scripts to get a gist of what happens. In short, two binaries are needed for the prompt to work. `bruh_lca` is a go program that outputs the elapsed time between two unix timestamps. `bruh_cpwd` is a tool that printed a customized compacted version of the current working directory. You may also feel free to write your own variants and replace them for ultimate customization.
